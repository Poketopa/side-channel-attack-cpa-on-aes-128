## CPA Analysis
### 1. Power Trace Collection
- Power traces were captured using an oscilloscope while performing AES encryption.
- Triggers were set at the **start of 9th round AddRoundKey** and **end of AES encryption**.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- The collected `.ets` power trace files were converted into `.traces` format using **estraces**.
- Extracted plaintexts, ciphertexts, and power traces were stored as `plaintext.txt`, `ciphertext.txt`, and `traces.traces`.

### 3. CPA Execution
- The attack targets **InvSBox** outputs in the **10th round of AES decryption**.
- The CPA algorithm correlates power traces with **Hamming Weight (HW)** of **InvSBox(ciphertext ⊕ key_guess)**.
- The key candidate with the highest correlation was selected.

### 4. Key Schedule Reversal
- The extracted **10th round key** was used to compute the **AES master key** by reversing the key schedule.
- Python scripts were utilized for the reversal process.

## Results
- Successfully extracted the **10th round AES key** through CPA.
- Used **AES key expansion reversal** to derive the **original master key**.
- Correlation coefficient graphs confirmed the effectiveness of the attack.
